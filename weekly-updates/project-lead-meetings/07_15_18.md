# Project Lead Meeting *07/15/18*

## Team Updates

* We have an allocation sheet - [on the drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SX0hXLaauSCtHQYmFvKXj-JvTxejarh3kWIdz5WWmFk/edit#gid=0).
* We have SnackRU, for once.
* After this, hopefully, you'll be able to fix your first meetings with architects and alumni.
* Please fill in last week's minutes if you haven't. We'd like to know what deadline you have
  in mind. (Feel free to just have 1 PR or whatever, just put in your deadline.)
* Today, we want to share some ideas on leading architects for your first meeting. Just because
  we've messed it up 2 or 3 times by now. There are some major goals:
  - make sure your architects know what they're doing.
  - make sure your architects know why they're doing it.
  - make sure your architects know what they need to know to do what they need to.

## Sub dividing projects: notes

You need to split up your projects to have architects work really well together.
This way, you also know what people are doing. Here are some ideas:
* divide issues and keep allocating them.
* If you have a design, see how that can be divided. (Min-cut, LOL.)
* *Suggested project division* (If you really need ideas of thinking how to divide your team think of it this way.  Then think of how you might want to divide it)
  * Frontend -> UI and interactions **outside** of the application
  * Backend -> Service and logic of the application **within the application**
  * QA testing -> Testing, enforcing proper practices, enforcing documentation. 

**Create a new branch, fill out this document for your project section, and create a pull request**

_UPDATES_: Login management is now done with separated UserForm and LoginForm components.  Main app connected to Redux store and tested to some extent.  Currently working on the cesspool known as the original `UserForm.js`

_QUESTIONS_: Working on Cookies through middleware, any suggestions would be considered.  If any documentation already exists for front-end, please let me know, otherwise I'm writing some for the sake of tracking what I'm doing.  I'll have to make new docs after it's all finished.
